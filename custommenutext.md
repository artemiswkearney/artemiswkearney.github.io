## CustomMenuText    
[*GitHub*](https://github.com/artemiswkearney/CustomMenuText)

A mod for Beat Saber that changes the logo in the main menu to display user-provided text.

Features:
- Chooses the text to display randomly from a configuration file. A new message is chosen every time the menu is re-entered (for example, after playing a song).

- By default, uses the "Beon" font older versions of Beat Saber displayed the logo with. However, the font can be changed by the user. Custom fonts must be compiled into a Unity AssetBundle, after which they can be loaded by the plugin and used to display any text.
